IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. Many formal Mardi Gras balls are PRIVATE EVENTS requiring krewe membership
   or special invitations. Public ticket availability is limited.

2. Ball information for 2026 is still being finalized by many krewes as of
   January 2026. Contact individual krewe offices for the most current details.

3. The weekend before Mardi Gras (Feb 13-15, 2026) traditionally features
   major parades rather than formal balls. Most prestigious balls occur on
   Mardi Gras evening itself.

4. Pricing for balls that do sell public tickets typically ranges from
   $100-$500+ depending on seating and krewe prestige.

5. Major krewes to contact for ball information:
   - Krewe of Proteus (certificate expired on website)
   - Krewe of Orpheus
   - Krewe of Bacchus
   - Krewe of Hermes
   - Krewe of Comus

RESEARCH CHALLENGES:

Due to the exclusive nature of Mardi Gras balls and the current date being
nearly a year before the event, detailed public information about formal
masquerade balls is limited. Many krewes have not yet published their 2026
ball information on public websites.
