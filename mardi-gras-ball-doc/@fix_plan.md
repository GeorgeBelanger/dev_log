## Notes
- Mardi Gras 2026 is Tuesday, February 17
- Target weekend is Friday Feb 13 - Sunday Feb 15, 2026
- Focus on FORMAL masquerade balls (not parades or casual events)
- Some balls may sell out early - note availability status
- Major krewes typically host the most prominent balls (Rex, Comus, Proteus, Bacchus, Endymion, etc.)
- Pricing can range from ~$100 to $500+ depending on the krewe and seating
- Many balls require krewe membership or invitations - note if public tickets available

## Key Findings from Research
- Most formal balls occur on Mardi Gras evening (Feb 17) rather than the weekend before
- The weekend before is dominated by parades, not formal balls
- Krewe of Endymion Extravaganza (Feb 14, 2026) is the main confirmed public event
- Many prestigious balls are private/members-only with no public ticket sales
- Information availability is limited 11+ months before the event
- Technical challenges with some krewe websites (expired SSL, connection issues)
