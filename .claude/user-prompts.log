yes i want to make the claude.md in the base directory - can you review this and see if this would accomplish what we are trying to do\
\
## Workflow Orchestration
### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately - don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity
### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution
### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update 'tasks/lessons.md"
with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project
### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness
### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes - don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it
### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests - then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how
## Task Management
1. **Plan First**: Write plan to "tasks/todo.md" with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to "tasks/todo.md"
**Capture Lessons**: Update "tasks/lessons.md' after corrections
## Core Principles
- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- **Minimal Impact**: Changes should only touch what's necessary Avoid introducing bugs.

• Tesla and Apple salary ranges are estimated based on levels.fyi/Glassdoor data (not posted on listings).
• Visa Principal ML and Affirm Senior Staff roles have confirmed salary ranges from postings.
• Browser automation was unavailable (no attached Chrome tab), limiting ability to scrape JS-rendered sites (Google, Apple, Meta, Wellfound). Future runs with browser access will yield more results.
• Several sources were rate-limited (Brave Search free plan: 1 req/sec). Spread across hourly runs.
